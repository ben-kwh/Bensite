I want to work on the important issues for society and enable others to do the same.\nDoing more with less has always resonated with my lazy brain. For the last dozen years, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked in energy efficiency and renewable programs for utility customers.

This has been a pivotal opportunity for me. Let the machines do the work, right? Well, I learned to code at the early age of 35, and have since expanded into data analytics, cloud engineering, and software product development. I absolutely love making humans and machines more intelligent. I\u0026rsquo;ve automated complex processes and created super-human cyborgs who access data and intelligence to improve their decision making. More importantly, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized my journey is replicable. I have leveled up multiple staff from \u0026lsquo;good with excel\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;employed data scientist\u0026rsquo;, and that is as rewarding as it gets.\nPut your money where your mouth is. I want to enable world changing tech that enables society too. I follow and invest in EV, energy storage, blockchain, and metaverse tech.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://examplesite.org/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Smart people should build cool stuff.
